# Installation:

1. Require elixir >= 1.6.0. I would recommend using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).
2. Run `mix deps.get` to install all dependencies.


# Pull Request:

1. Ensure there are either unit or doctest.
2. Ensure all test pass by running `mix test`.
3. Run `mix format` to standardize code style.
4. Run `mix dialyzer` to detect type errors.
